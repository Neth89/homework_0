                        <br> Hello my name is Solina Neth! Unfortunately you have landed on my biograph page. I don't consider myself a very interesting person but hopefully you have a different opinion. I was born and raised in the most boring city ever Modesto, California! There is literally nothing to do there. I can tell you though that the famous director George Lucas was from Modesto and that's probably the best thing that happened to my city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm pretty much your typical girl. I love watching romantic comedies, hiking around the beach, and eating as much as I can. I love to explore different foods! If you have any restaurants you would like to recommend please visit my contact page leave your name, email, and a message so we can eat together!
                        <br>
